You need to calculate the velocity vector of a ball depending on its coordinates

Using that vector, you should be able to calculate the coordinates of the ball
after any given amount of time

You should also be able to tell whether the ball will hit the paddle
and at which angle

The paddle is located on the plane z == 0

USAGE
	./101pong x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1 n

DESCRIPTION
	x0, y0, z0 coordinates at time t - 1 (double)
	x1, y1, z1 coordinates at time t (double)
	n          time shift
